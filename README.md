# Game Search App - React version
## My very first React app

* Connects to the Giantbomb video game database API and retrieves data using **fetch-jsonp**.
* Uses **JSONP** format because of CORS.
* Includes a *search* feature, passing the selected result to a new page using *React Routes*, and showing more *details* about the selected item.
* It is still very basic and rudimentary since this is my first time learning React. I may work on it more in the future
* It only has basic styling for now, since the main focus of this project is learning React and API connectivity.

## Future plans:
- [ ] Exception handling and QA.
- [ ] Figuring out pagination, since it only shows first 12 results.
- [ ] Better CSS styling.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
